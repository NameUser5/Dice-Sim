Dice simulator

***Pseudocode:***

1. Have 6 die faces
   1. create images of each individual face
2. Roll
   1. User input --> button
3. Choose one face from 6
   1. random from range 0-6
   2. If statements OR
   3. classes


Once above program is done, I will try letting the user pick their dice style/color, and create classes for each style.

***Files***
1. main (only pass root through main)
2. gui; have the following in gui:
   1. root class
      1. images
      2. roll function (TBD: I may put in different file)

***Imports***
1. random
2. tkinter
3. gui file into main
4. TBD function file into gui


***Additions***
1. Make elements scale with window if resized
2. add hover text to inert sprites
   1. e.g. *when mouse is on cards:* "This isn't poker!"
3. Add border to window -- like an actual casino table
   1. Can an image/texture be used for this???

###LEVEL UP:

1. Tabs:
   1. 2-dice roll --> base code DONE :) Now I must move this to the tab
   2. 2-dice roll, multi-color
   3. 2-dice roll, multi-color, with animation

Misc Notes:
1. how to constrict label into specific space?
2. TKDefaultFont
3. Toolkit
